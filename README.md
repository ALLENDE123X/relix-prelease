## Project Overview

Relix is an AI-powered changelog generator that addresses the common pain point developers face when manually creating changelogs by automating the process through intelligent commit analysis and natural language generation.

### The Problem I Solve

Developers and teams frequently need to:
1. **Manually review days/weeks of commits** to understand what changed
2. **Summarize technical changes** into user-friendly language
3. **Create consistent, professional changelogs** for releases

This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in incomplete or poorly formatted changelogs.

### My Solution

Relix automates this entire workflow by:
- **Fetching commit data** from any public GitHub repository
- **Analyzing commit messages** using advanced AI models
- **Generating professional changelogs** with proper categorization and formatting
- **Preventing duplicate entries** through intelligent overlap detection
- **Providing multiple input methods** (date ranges, tags, commit SHAs)

## Live Demo

**Try it now:** [https://relix-prelease.vercel.app](https://relix-prelease.vercel.app)

### Quick Start Demo:
1. Visit the [console page](https://relix-prelease.vercel.app/console)
2. Enter a repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/facebook/react`)
3. Select a date range or tag range
4. Click "Generate Draft" to see AI-generated changelog
5. Edit and publish your changelog

## User-Centered Product Design

### Developer-First Experience Design

As a tool built for developers, every design decision prioritized the developer experience and workflow efficiency:

#### **Intuitive Input Methods**
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Developers can input repositories via URL, which matches their daily workflow of copying GitHub URLs
- **Flexible Range Selection**: Three distinct modes (date, tag, SHA) accommodate different release management practices
- **Smart Defaults**: Automatically detects main/master branch and suggests reasonable date ranges

#### **Cognitive Load Reduction**
- **Single-Page Workflow**: Entire changelog creation process happens on one page to minimize context switching
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced options are hidden until needed, keeping the interface clean
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between input, generation, and editing phases

#### **Developer Workflow Integration**
- **Markdown-First**: Outputs in markdown format that developers already use for documentation
- **Commit Traceability**: Includes commit SHAs so developers can trace back to specific changes
- **Branch-Aware**: Understands Git workflows and branch-based development

#### **Error Prevention & Recovery**
- **Overlap Detection**: Prevents duplicate work by checking for existing changelogs in the same commit range
- **Validation Feedback**: Real-time validation prevents wasted generation attempts
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear error messages with actionable next steps

#### **Efficiency Optimizations**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power users can generate (⌘+Enter) and publish (⌘+Shift+Enter) without mouse interaction
- **Auto-Save Drafts**: Preserves work during editing sessions
- **Instant Preview**: Live markdown rendering eliminates the edit-preview cycle

#### **Accessibility & Inclusion**
- **Screen Reader Support**: Full ARIA labeling for developers using assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete functionality available without mouse interaction
- **High Contrast Modes**: Dark and light themes with WCAG-compliant contrast ratios

### User Research Insights Applied

#### **Pain Point: Manual Changelog Creation**
- **Problem**: Developers spend hours manually reviewing commits and writing changelogs
- **Solution**: AI-powered automation that understands technical context and generates professional summaries

#### **Pain Point: Inconsistent Formatting**
- **Problem**: Different team members create changelogs with varying styles and completeness
- **Solution**: Standardized categorization (Features, Bug Fixes, Internal Changes) with consistent formatting

#### **Pain Point: Missing Context**
- **Problem**: Changelogs often lack sufficient detail for users to understand impact
- **Solution**: Intelligent commit grouping and technical detail preservation while maintaining readability

#### **Pain Point: Duplicate Work**
- **Problem**: Teams accidentally create overlapping changelogs or miss important changes
- **Solution**: Database-backed overlap detection and comprehensive commit range validation

## Design Decisions & Tech Stack

### Technology Stack Choices
I chose modern, production-ready technologies that work well together, with particular attention to alignment with Greptile's tech stack to demonstrate familiarity with their ecosystem:

- **React/TypeScript**: Type-safe frontend development with excellent developer experience
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities and excellent tooling
- **OpenAI**: Industry-leading AI models for natural language generation
- **Helicone**: Production-grade LLM observability and monitoring
- **PostHog**: Comprehensive product analytics and user behavior tracking

This stack provides a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable applications while leveraging best-in-class tools for AI integration and user analytics. The alignment with Greptile's technology choices also showcases my ability to work effectively within their existing development ecosystem.

### Development Tools & Workflow

#### **AI-Assisted Development**
- **Cursor**: Used as the primary IDE with AI-powered code suggestions that were reviewed and approved by the developer
- **v0.dev**: Utilized to generate initial frontend components and layouts, which were then heavily refined and customized to match the specific requirements and design system

#### **Modern Development Workflow**
The development process leveraged AI tools to accelerate initial development while maintaining high code quality through human oversight:

1. **Initial Prototyping**: v0.dev generated foundational UI components and page layouts
2. **Code Enhancement**: Cursor provided intelligent code suggestions during development
3. **Human Review**: All AI-generated code was carefully reviewed, tested, and refined
4. **Custom Implementation**: Significant customization and optimization beyond initial AI outputs

This hybrid approach combined the speed of AI-assisted development with the quality assurance of human expertise, resulting in a production-ready application that meets professional standards.
